    "\n",
    "LangChain offers a generic interface compatible with nearly any LLM. This generic interface facilitates a centralized development environment so that data scientists can seamlessly integrate LLM-powered applications with external data sources and software workflows. This integration is crucial for organizations looking to harness AI's full potential in their processes.\n",

    "One of LangChain's most powerful features is its module-based approach. This approach supports flexibility when performing experiments and the optimization of interactions with LLMs. Data scientists can dynamically compare prompts and switch between foundation models without significant code modifications.

Each neuron receives one or more inputs, performs a computation on those inputs, and then sends the output to other neurons. The computation typically involves a weighted sum of the inputs followed by the application of an activation function.\n",

      "2. **Eliminate Distractions:** Find a quiet, well-lit space for your online classes, away from noisy areas and potential distractions such as social media, television, or household chores. Use noise-canceling headphones if necessary, and consider using apps or browser extensions that block distracting websites during class time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prepare in Advance:** Before each class, review the syllabus, familiarize yourself with the course materials, and complete any assigned readings or exercises. This preparation will help you actively engage in class discussions and make the most of your learning experience. Additionally, ensure your technology (computer, webcam, microphone) is functioning correctly and that you have a stable internet connection.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Limit distractions: Identify common distractions in your work environment and take steps to minimize them. This may include turning off notifications on your phone, using website blockers, or finding a quiet workspace. By reducing interruptions, you can maintain focus and increase productivity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Chains solve a fundamental problem with LLMs. Chains are primarily designed to handle a single prompt and generate a single response.

    "\n",
    "**Note:** While both approaches are presented here for educational purposes, **LCEL is the recommended pattern for new development.** The SequentialChain approach continues to be supported for backward compatibility, but the LangChain community has largely transitioned to the LCEL pattern for its superior flexibility and expressiveness.\n"
